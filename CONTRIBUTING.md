# Contributing to PDM

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions include but are not restricted to:

- Reporting bugs
- Contributing to code
- Writing tests
- Writing documents

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing.

## A recommended flow of contributing to an open source project.

This guideline is for new beginners of OSS. If you are an experienced OSS developer, you can skip this section.

1. First, fork this project to your own namespace using the fork button at the top right of the repository page.

2. Clone the **upstream** repository to local:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/pi-dal/django-vditor.git
   # Or if you prefer SSH clone:
   $ git clone git@github.com:pi-dal/django-vditor.git
   # Or if you prefer gh repo:
   $ gh repo clone pi-dal/django-vditor
   ```

3. Add the fork as a new remote:

   ```bash
   $ git remote add fork https://github.com/yourname/django-vditor.git
   $ git fetch fork
   ```

   where `fork` is the remote name of the fork repository.

**ProTips:**

1. Don't modify code on the master branch, the master branch should always keep track of origin/master.

   To update master branch to date:

   ```bash
   $ git pull origin master
   # In rare cases that your local master branch diverges from the remote master:
   $ git fetch origin && git reset --hard master
   ```

2. Create a new branch based on the up-to-date master for new patches.

3. Create a Pull Request from that patch branch.

## Local development

First, install package management tools `pdm`.

```bash
# If you are on MacOS and using homebrew, install it by:
$ brew install pdm
# Otherwise, it is recommended to install pdm in an isolated environment with pipx:
$ pipx install pdm
# Or you can install it under a user site:
$ pip install --user pdm
```

Then, configure the shell according to the [document](https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally).

Finally, You need to use `pdm` to install development dependencies: 

```bash
$ pdm sync -d
```

## Test code coverage

In fact, when you install the development dependency, you already have `coverage` installed, but if you are installing it in another way, please install it first:

```bash
$ pdm add -d coverage 
```

Then, use `coverage` to start testing code coverage: 

```bash
$ python3 -m coverage run manage.py test
# Get XML file
$ python3 -m coverage xml
```
